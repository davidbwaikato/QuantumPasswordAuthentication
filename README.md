# QuantumPasswordAuthentication

Welcome!

In a post-quantum world, where attackers may have access to full-scale quantum computers, all classical password-based authentication schemes will be compromised. Quantum
copy-protection prevents adversaries from making copies of existing quantum software; we suggest this as a possible approach for designing post-quantum-secure password authentication systems. This repository, QuantumPasswordAuthentication, contains the implementation of such a system.

This repository has been tested on Python 3.7.10, Qiskit 0.24.0, and liboqs 0.4.0.

The code is provided as both a notebook and python file. Please use the appropriate folder for accessing the code.
